# THE COCCOC software (Clash Of Code 2018)
This code was tested and can run on both Window and Linux.
This code executes faster on Linux.
The file **coccoc** has been compiled completely for Linux.
## HOW TO USE? 
### 1.COMPILE
```
g++ coccoc.cpp -std=c++1z -O3 -o coccoc
```
### 2.RUN
Works on command-line with this interface:
```
coccoc “many words” [path to directory]
```
If [path to directory] be omitted, the program works on current directory
